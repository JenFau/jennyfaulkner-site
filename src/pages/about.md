Five years ago, when I first set up this site in Wordpress, I wrote: 

> I am passionate about the people side of projects and business change.

This is still my passion, and a strength, but for the past couple of years I've been more directed towards the quantitative side of business analysis. It's fascinating to see how that side - the data and numbers - is now becoming more and more part of the capabilities of AI, and I'm interested to see how things develop. 

I also wrote in the original 'about' page: 

> I'm two years into a part time     philosophy degree. 

I've now finished that degree and that - in theory, at least - gives me time to explore some more of my many, many interests. So I've restarted a [digital garden](https://notes.jennyfaulkner.com). As those thoughts become more developed, they will pages on this site. There *should* be more activity over there than here, but the notes will be rawer and shorter and more random.

> Philosophy teaches you to **think**, and what could be better than that?

I'm still fascinated by the way that humans think - or, in fact, seemingly often *don't* think. And, with the rise of AI now performing so much of the linear 'thinking' that has been taught for so long, how humans will need to develop their own models of thinking to more critically engage with AI. So, that's a starting point for exploration. 

On the subject of thinking differently, a formal diagnosis of neurodivergence two years ago finally illuminated why I've always felt that I *do* think differently to others. That, and (just a few months later) coming to faith after many years of heavy scepticism, has been truly transformative. I'm still exploring who I am and who I'm becoming - on both accounts.

Finally, five years ago I wrote: 

> I prefer coffee to tea, savoury to sweet, and I'm happiest when I'm by the sea. 

And *that*, my friends, hasn't changed at all...
