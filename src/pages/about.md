Five years ago, when I first set up this site in Wordpress, I wrote:

This is my passion, and a strength, but for the past couple of years I've been more directed towards the quantitative side of business analysis. It's fascinating to see how that side - the data and numbers - is now becoming more and more part of the capabilities of AI, and I'm interested to see how things develop. 

I also wrote in the original 'about' page:
